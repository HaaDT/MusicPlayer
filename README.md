# MusicPlayer

==========================================================================

A music player project made in C#

This project was made by two students for a project in C# at school, Don't expect anything too much from this, and it's just a simple music player, but it has the ability to connect to a database to play music online and everything else

It's all in Brazilian Portuguese because it's for school
